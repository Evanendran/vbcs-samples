Each directory of this repository represents an example that can be used within VB.

Within each directory, the contents of the 'visual-app' directory can be imported to an existing
app via the 'import resources' feature of VB.
- from the visual-app folder of the desired app, "zip -r <filename>.zip ."
- create a new app in design-time (or use an existing app; the 'employee' web app will be added)
- import the ZIP using 'Import Resources'

Data required for the app (imported into the business objects) are within the 'data' directory.
