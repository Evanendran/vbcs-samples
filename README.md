Each directory of this repository represents an example that can be used within Visual Builder Cloud Services (VBCS).

```
  <sample_name>
  + resources
  + <sample_name>.zip
  + readme.md
```

readme.md
---

The readme.md file in each sample describes what the sample does and what you need in order to run it. Any dependencies or prerequisites will be called out in this file. 

<sample_name>.zip
---

This zip file can be used in the VB designer from the "Import" button to import the sample into your environment. Note that additional set up steps may be required, and if so, they will be noted in the readme.md for that sample.

resources directory
---

The resources directory contains the source code for the sample. This is provided as a convenience in case you just want to browse the code in the git repository without installing the sample.
